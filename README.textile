"Pyccuracy":http://pyccuracy.org is a "Behaviour-Driven-Development-style":http://behaviour-driven.org tool written in Python that aims to make it easier to write automated acceptance tests. It improves the readability of those tests by using a structured natural language - and a simple mechanism to extend this language - so that both developers and customers can collaborate and understand what the tests do.
