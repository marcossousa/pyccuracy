As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test that I can navigate to a custom page
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that navigating to a custom page works
Given
    I go to Google Search
When
    I fill "query" textbox with "Hello World"
    And I click "search" button
Then
    #google loads
