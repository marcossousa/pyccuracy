As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the main actions using xpath notation
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Check div, paragraph and unordered lines by xpath
Given
	I go to "xpath_page_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	# Check div's contents
	I see "//table/tbody/tr/td/form/table/tbody/tr/td/div" div
	I see "//table/tbody/tr/td/form/table/tbody/tr/td/div" div contains "<p>contains something</p>" markup
	I see "//table/tbody/tr/td/form/table/tbody/tr/td/div" div contains "contains something"
	# Check UL and LI items
	I see "//ul" ul
	I see "//li" li
	# Paragraph's check
	I see "//td/p" paragraph

Scenario 2 - Checking that a given checkbox gets checked and verify a checked checkbox by xpath notation
Given
	I go to "xpath_page_tests.htm"
When
	I check the "//input[@type='checkbox']" checkbox
Then
	I see the "//input[@type='checkbox']" checkbox is checked
	And I see the "//input[@type='checkbox'][1]" checkbox is checked

Scenario 3 - Checking that we can click an image by xpath notation
Given
    I go to "xpath_page_tests.htm"
When
    I click "//img" image
Then
    I see "It Works!" title

Scenario 4 - Checking that we can click a link by xpath notation
Given
	I go to "xpath_page_tests.htm"
When
	I click "//a[contains(text(),'Click me')]" link and wait
Then
	I see "It Works!" title
	
Scenario 5 - Checking that we can click a button by xpath notation
Given
	I go to "xpath_page_tests.htm"
When
	I click "//button[@type='submit']" link and wait
Then
	I see "It Works!" title
	
Scenario 6 - Checking that a given radiobox gets checked and verify a checked radiobox by xpath notation
Given
	I go to "xpath_page_tests.htm"
When
	I check the "//input[@type='radio']" radio
Then
	I see the "//input[@type='radio']" radio is checked
	And I see the "//input[@type='radio'][1]" radio is checked
	
Scenario 7 - Changing the selected index of a select by xpath notation
Given
	I go to "xpath_page_tests.htm"
When
	I select the option with index of 1 in "//select" select
Then
	I see "//select" select has selected index of 1
	
Scenario 8 - Filling diferents textboxes by xpath notation
Given
	I go to "xpath_page_tests.htm"
When
	I fill "//tr[9]/td/input" textbox with "Some text"
	And I fill "//tr[10]/td/input" textbox with "Some other text"
Then
	I see "//tr[9]/td/input" textbox matches "Some text"
	And I see "//tr[10]/td/input" textbox matches "Some other text"
	
Scenario 9 - Filling textarea by xpath notation
Given
	I go to "xpath_page_tests.htm"
When
	I fill "//textarea" textbox with "Some text"
Then
	I see "//textarea" textbox matches "Some text"
