As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the built-in browser confirmation dialog
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Confirme message from input button click
Given
    I go to "confirmation_dialog_tests.htm"
When
    I click "btnConfirmation1" button
Then
    I confirm the message "Are you sure about it?"

Scenario 2 - Confirming a message from a button and try next operations
Given
    I go to "confirmation_dialog_tests.htm"
When
    I click "btnConfirmation2" button
	I confirm the message "Você deseja a exclusão do registro?"
Then
	I go to "http://www.google.com"
	I wait for the page to load for 10 seconds
	And I fill "q" textbox with "It works"
	
Scenario 3 - Confirming a message from a submitting button to another page
Given
    I go to "confirmation_dialog_tests.htm"
When
    I click "q" button
	I confirm the message "Do you want to go to Google Home Page?"
	And I wait for the page to load for 10 seconds
Then
	I fill "q" textbox with "It works"
	And I see "Pyccuracy - Google Search" title
