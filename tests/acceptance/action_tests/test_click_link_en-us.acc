As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the click link action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that we can click a link by name
Given
	I go to "link_tests.htm"
When
	I click "lnkItWorks" link and wait
Then
	I see "It Works!" title
	
Scenario 2 - Checking that we can click a link by id
Given
	I go to "link_tests.htm"
When
	I click "lnkItWorks2" link and wait
Then
	I see "It Works!" title

Scenario 3 - Checking that we can click a link by text
Given
       I go to "link_tests.htm"
When
       I click "It Worked 2" link and wait
Then
       I see "It Works!" title
